# A Splink Demonstration

A slightly annotated version of one of the examples from <https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink>

## Quick start

For Mac users, you can run the following commands in your terminal to get started:

```bash
brew install uv
cd [preferred directory]
git clone git@github.com:asimy/splink_demonstration.git
cd splink_demonstration
uv sync
uv run jupyter lab
```

Once Jupiter Lab is running, open the `deduplicate_50k_synthetic.ipynb` notebook
and follow along.
